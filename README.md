# Double Pendulum Simulator

## Overview

In physics and mathematics, in the area of dynamical systems, a `double pendulum` is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, and is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions. The motion of a `double pendulum` is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic.

## Functionality and MVP

* Users are able to define the mass of each pendulum.
* Users can define the length of each limb.
* Users can also see the motion of the double compound pendulum.

### Wireframes

The app will consist of a single screen where the motion of the double pendulum is displayed, and a setting section to the side.
