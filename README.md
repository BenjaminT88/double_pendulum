# Double Pendulum Simulator

## Overview

In physics and mathematics, in the area of dynamical systems, a `double pendulum` is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, and is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions. The motion of a `double pendulum` is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations and is chaotic.

Several variants of the double pendulum may be considered; the two limbs may be of equal or unequal lengths and masses, they may be `simple pendulums` or `compound pendulums`.

## Functionality and MVP

* Users are able to define the mass of each pendulum.
* Users can define the length of each limb.
* Users can also see the motion of the double compound pendulum.

### Wireframes

The app will consist of a single screen where the motion of the double pendulum is displayed, and a setting section to the side.

### Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

* `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM rendering
* `p5.js` for drawing functionality

### Timeline

Day 1: Study up on the physics behind the chaotic movements of double compound pendulum. Play around with p5.js and get a good hang of it.

Day 2: Create the basic simulation of single pendulum

Day 3: Create the basic simulation of double pendulum

Day 4: Expand the simulation to display double compound pendulum and settings
